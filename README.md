# Few Lattice Points 3D

This extension provides methods for the computation of 3 dimensional lattice polytopes with few lattice points

The data can (soon) be found at
https://polyDB.org
in the collection FewLatticePoints3D

For the algorithm see 
Blanco, Monica and Santos, Francisco, On the enumeration of lattice 3-polytopes, arxiv 1601.02577
